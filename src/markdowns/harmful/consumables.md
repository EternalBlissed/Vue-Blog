# Consumables

In our current capitalistic world, the term "food" has degraded past belief, we have normalised the consumption of pure chemicals made in a lab that have been moulded and designed to appear and taste "good" were in reality, degrade and kill the human body.

### A perfect example

McDonald's Big Mac (Australian Recipe)

BIG MAC BUN: Wheat Flour (Vitamins (Thiamin, Folate)), Water, Sugar, Canola Oil, Sesame Seeds, Potato Starch, Glaze, Wheat Gluten, Iodised Salt, Yeast, Improver (Wheat Flour, Enzymes (Contain Wheat), Antioxidant (300), Malted Wheat Flour), Emulsifiers (472e, 471), Preservative (282), Natural Flavour.

That it a lot of stuff right? Well thats only the bun, lets break it down.

- **Sugar:** Excessive consumption can lead to obesity, diabetes, and other health issues.
- **Canola Oil:** Rapeseed (canola) oil aggravates metabolic syndrome-like conditions in male but not in female stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats 
- **Wheat Gluten:** Problematic for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivities.
- **Iodised Salt:** High intake can lead to hypertension in sensitive individuals.
- **Preservative (282):** Calcium propionate, which some studies suggest linked to irritability, restlessness, inattention, and sleep disturbance in some children.
- **Emulsifiers (472e, 471):** Generally recognized as safe, but some individuals prefer to avoid synthetic emulsifiers due to potential gut microbiota disturbances.
- **Antioxidant (300):** Ascorbic acid, generally safe but in large doses can cause stomach pain and diarrhea.
