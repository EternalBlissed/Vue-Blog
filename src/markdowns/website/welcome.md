## Structure

- Each blog file is written in markdown, in the `markdowns` folder, catagorised under specific folders e.g "people".

- Metadata including id, date, time and description is defined in `blogs.json` in the statics folder.

- For example:

```
{
  "website": [
    {
      "id": "welcome",
      "date": "2024-04-25",
      "title": "Welcome to my blog!",
      "description": "A very quick guide on this site."
    }
  ],
}
```

## Known Issues:

- Code text falling out of container on mobile.

- Shitty background css hard-code. (as shown with footer being at the top of the page)
